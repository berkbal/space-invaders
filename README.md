just tested out kaboomJS for a first time. it just a dirty project for testing kaboom's abilities. and it looks amazing!

- **Completely removed because Kaboom removed 'addButton' function for some reason.**


It can be tested from here: https://berkbal.github.io/space-invaders-clone-with-kaboomJS/
