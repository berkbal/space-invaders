just tested out kaboomJS for a first time. its a dirty project for just testing kaboom's abilities. And it looks amazing!

- **Completely removed main menu because Kaboom removed 'addButton' function for some reason.**

It can be tested from here: https://berkbal.github.io/space-invaders-clone-with-kaboomJS/
