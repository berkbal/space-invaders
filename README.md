## What is Space Invaders?

It is an arcade game developed by Tomohiro Nishikado and published in 1978.

### What is this project about?

It's a simple remake of Space Invaders with Javascript. I wanted to test out Kaboom JS when it was released, but the Kaboom JS project is no longer maintained. It has a fork named [KaPlay.](https://github.com/kaplayjs/kaplay)


The game can be tested via [Github pages.](https://berkbal.github.io/space-invaders-clone-with-kaboomJS/)
