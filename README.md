## What is Space Invaders?

It is an arcade game developed by Tomohiro Nishikado and published in 1978.

### What is this project about?

It's a simple remake of Space Invaders with Javascript. I wanted to test out <a href="https://kaboomjs.com/">Kaboom.js</a> when it was released, but the Kaboom JS project is no longer maintained. It has a fork named [KaPlay.](https://github.com/kaplayjs/kaplay)

## Controls

- **F** : Fullscreen
- ←↑→↓ : Movement
- **Space** : Shoot

The game can be tested and can be played via [Github pages.](https://berkbal.github.io/space-invaders/)
